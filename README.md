pycda: Python Cost Distance Analysis

Overview
===
`pycda` is a Python package designed to facilitate Cost Distance Analysis (CDA) methods.
It wraps implementations for least-cost graph algorithms from `scikit-image` and `scipy.sparse` to provide key CDA algorithms including least-cost path, cumulative costs tree, and least cost allocation. 
The package offers support for both omnidirectional cost-rasters and directional costs.
It is meant to be used with `rioxarray` rasters.

Features
===
- Least-Cost Path: trace the least-cost path between two points on a cost raster
- Cumulative Cost Tree: Generate a cumulative cost raster given a set of one or more origin points
- Least Cost Allocation: Determine the nearest origin point to each cell in a raster

Usage
===

TBD
